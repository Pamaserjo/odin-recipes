    <p>Cooking a very good steak on the stovetop goes like this: Buy the best steak for pan-searing (boneless NY strip or rib-eye), season it very well with kosher salt for just 30 minutes before you plan to cook it, and finally cook it hot and fast with no oil to start and some butter to finish. What about the steak resting step? Well, it turns out resting might not be as important as we all once thought. More on that juicy tidbit below. </p>
